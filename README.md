# SolidPrincipleConcepts

- `S` -> Single Responsibility Principle (Class should have only 1 reason to change / 1 responsibility)
- `O` -> Open/Closed Principle (Open for extension but closed for modification)
- `L` -> Liskov Substitution Principle (If class B is a subtype of class A, then we should be able to replace the object 
        of A with B without breaking the behaviour of the program)
        ------ Subclass should extend the capability of parent not narrow it down ------
- `I` -> Interface Segregation Principle
- `D` -> Dependency Inversion Principle
