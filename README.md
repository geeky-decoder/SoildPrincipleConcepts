# SolidPrincipleConcepts

- `S` -> Single Responsibility Principle (Class should have only 1 reason to change / 1 responsibility)
- `O` -> Open/Closed Principle (Open for extension but closed for modification)
- `L` -> Liskov Substitution Principle (If class B is a subtype of class A, then we should be able to replace the object 
        of A with B without breaking the behaviour of the program)

        -+-+-+-+-+- Subclass should extend the capability of parent not narrow it down -+-+-+-+-+-
- `I` -> Interface Segregation Principle (Interfaces shouldn't force classes to implement what they can't do. Large
        interfaces should be divided into smaller ones)
- `D` -> Dependency Inversion Principle (Class should depend on interfaces rather than concrete classes)


## Advantages

- Easy to maintain
- Easy to understand
- Flexible Software
- Reduce Complexity
